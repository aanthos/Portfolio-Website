        <p class="about-summary"> 
            Hello! I am a recent Applied Computing Technology graduate from Colorado State University and eager to help the development of a company. 
            With the flexibility of the Applied Computing Technology major, I had the opportunity to continually challenge myself with Computer Science
            courses and projects involving distributed systems and web applications.  Throughout these courses and projects, I worked effectively in groups
            to develop solutions to complex, field-specific problems and communicated through writing about technical activities. As of now, I am also
            working on several side projects involving modern JavaScript frameworks including Vue.js and Angular 8. I am more than ready to apply my
            knowledge and skills in the computer software industry.
